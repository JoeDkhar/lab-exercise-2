                <h2>What is climate change?</h2>
                <p>Climate change is a change in the usual weather patterns in a region over time. Temperatures on Earth have been rising dramatically for many years. This change is impacting local climates all around the world.

                <br>Changes in weather happen all the time. But weather and climate are not the same thing. Weather is the day to day change in temperature and precipitation in a place. You can describe the weather in your community by looking outside. If it’s cold and snowy right now, that’s today’s weather.
                    
                <br>Climate, on the other hand, is the usual weather in a place over a long period of time. Weather can change quickly. It might be sunny in the morning and rainy in the afternoon. Climate changes much more slowly. Until recently, Earth’s climate had been about the same for 9000 years.</p>

                <h2>How do we know the world’s climate is changing?</h2>
                <p>The world’s average temperature has changed throughout history. Sometimes the world’s temperature has been warmer and sometimes it has been colder. Factors like ocean currents and volcanic eruptions caused these shifts. They are part of a natural cycle of heating and cooling. This usually happens over tens of thousands of years.

                <br>But now Earth’s climate is changing faster than it ever has during human history. Earth’s average temperature has increased by at least 1.1 °C since 1880. And most of that warming has happened since 1975. In fact, 2023 will probably be the warmest year ever recorded. 

                <br>This trend of rising global temperatures is called Global warming. Global warming is one of the ways that Earth’s climate is changing. Climate change also involves changing global weather patterns, ocean currents, and other systems.
                
                <br>We are already experiencing these changes. Scientists have observed rising sea levels, melting ice and increasing extreme weather events. These changes affect each region differently. For example, snow and ice are melting so quickly that the Arctic could have no summer sea ice by 2030. Coastal areas are experiencing more flooding. These are all evidence of climate change.</p>

                <h2>How can we tackle this problem?</h2>
                <p>Our response will determine how much our climate will change. There are two main ways to deal with climate change. These are adaptation and mitigation. Adaptation is about finding ways to cope with our changing climate. For example, cities could adapt to rising sea levels by building walls or using pumps to prevent flooding.

                <br>Mitigation is about finding ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, we could burn less fossil fuel by using cars and other gas-powered vehicles less. We can also use solar or wind power, instead of fossil fuels, to generate electricity. These changes need work and cooperation from people around the world.

                <br>TClimate change is a difficult issue to solve because of its global scale and complexity. Luckily, many people are concerned about climate change. Young people in particular are encouraging governments and businesses to take action. Many organizations are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Government plans, international agreements, and emerging technologies will all need to play a role. There is a lot of work and research that still needs to be done. But we humans are up for it!</p>
