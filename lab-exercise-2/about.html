                        <li>SCALE is one of six thematic information services provided by the Copernicus Earth Observation Programme of the European Union.</li>
                        <li>SCALE is an operational programme building on existing research infrastructures and knowledge available in Europe and elsewhere.</li>
                        <li>SCALE relies on climate research carried out within the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and responds to user requirements defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).</li>
                        <li>SCALE provides an important resource to the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS).</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>We provide climate data and information on impacts on a range of topics and sectoral areas through our Climate Data Store (CDS).</li>
                        <li>The CDS is designed to enable users to tailor services to more specific public or commercial needs.</li>
                        <li>Our work complements the established range of meteorological and environmental services that each European country already has in place.</li>
                        <li>We derive maximum benefit from the existing infrastructure and knowledge by involving national climate service providers as well as relevant academic communities in the implementation of C3S.</li>
                        <li>We share updates on developments to our service at many meetings and workshops, including our annual General Assemblies.</li>
                        <li>These meetings also allow members of the climate change community to join networking and brainstorming sessions to contribute to future developments of C3S.</li>
                        <li>We also offer technical support as well as training to users of the CDS, combining online learning with face-to-face events in most countries across Europe.</li>
